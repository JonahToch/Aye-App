# Aye App

## About

Aye app was created as a way for Jonah Toch (and friends) to learn the MEAN techstack and to create useful, fun software along the way.

It is developed infrequently on weekday evenings when there is time so there are no consistent updates.

The app has many different unrelated features and is sort of charcuterie board of features and fun things to do.
